\qquad In this experiment, the elastic properties of a glass  namely the Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus, through Cornu's method, which utilizes optical interferometry to analyze beam deformation under applied loads. A rectangular glass beam supported on knife edges was loaded with known masses to induce bending, while a flat glass plate positioned atop the beam produced an interference fringe pattern when illuminated by monochromatic sodium light (\(\lambda \approx 589.3\,\mathrm{nm}\)). By measuring the fringe displacements in both horizontal and vertical orientations, squared fringe separations were plotted against fringe order and analyzed via linear regression to determine the radii of curvature, \(R_x\) and \(R_y\). From these measurements, the Poisson's ratio was calculated using \(\sigma = R_x/R_y\) and was found to be \(0.40 \pm 0.02\), which represents a 33.33\% overestimation compared to the standard value for soda-lime glass (\(\sigma_\text{ref} \approx 0.30\)). Moreover, using beam-bending theory, Young's modulus was computed from the horizontal curvature data and the geometric parameters of the beam, yielding \(E = 73.81 \pm 1.86\,\mathrm{GPa}\), which falls within 10.48\% of the lower and 4.25\% of the upper bounds of the typical reference range for glass (\(65\)--\(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\)). These results agree well with standard values, thereby validating the experimental approach and demonstrating the effectiveness of Cornu's method in determining key mechanical properties of materials.

\section{\centering INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:INTRODUCTION}
\indent

Understanding the mechanical properties of materials is a fundamental aspect of physics and engineering. In this experiment, the elastic characteristics of a glass beam are determined by measuring its Poisson's ratio, \(\sigma\), and Young's modulus, \(E\), using Cornu's method. These properties provide critical insights into the deformation behavior under applied loads: while Young's modulus quantifies the material's stiffness, Poisson's ratio describes the ratio of transverse contraction to axial extension when the material is stressed.\\

The experiment involves subjecting a rectangular glass beam to controlled bending by suspending known masses at its extremities. A flat glass plate is placed atop the beam, creating a thin air wedge that produces an interference fringe pattern when illuminated by monochromatic sodium light (\(\lambda \approx 589.3\,\mathrm{nm}\)). The interference fringes, observed via a stage telescope fitted with micrometer screws, shift as the beam deforms. By precisely measuring the positions of these fringes in both horizontal and vertical orientations, the radii of curvature in the bending directions can be extracted through linear regression of the squared displacement data against the fringe order.\\

The radii of curvature are directly related to the bending stress and strain in the beam; specifically, \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) are used to compute the Poisson's ratio via the relation 
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{R_x}{R_y},
\end{equation}

where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
and the horizontal curvature \(R_x\) is further employed in the standard beam-bending formula to calculate Young's modulus \(E\). This experiment not only reinforces theoretical concepts from elasticity but also demonstrates the practical application of optical interferometry in measuring material properties. The results obtained are compared with typical literature values for glass to assess the accuracy and reliability of Cornu's method in determining these important physical parameters.

\section{\centering THEORY}
\label{sec:THEORY}
% Theory Part
\indent

The mechanical behavior of materials under bending can be characterized by parameters such as Young's modulus, \(E\), and Poisson's ratio, \(\sigma\). In this experiment, Cornu's method is employed to determine these properties by analyzing the interference fringes produced in a thin air wedge formed between a bent glass beam and a flat glass plate. When the beam, which is supported on two knife edges and loaded by known masses, bends, its upper surface acquires curvature in both the horizontal and vertical directions. These curvatures are described by the radii \(R_x\) (horizontal) and \(R_y\) (vertical), and they reflect the underlying stress and strain distributions generated by the applied load \autocite{USMYoungPoisson}.\\

The interference pattern arises from the superposition of light waves reflecting from the beam and the plate. If the surfaces were in perfect contact, no fringes would be observed; however, the bending of the beam creates a varying air gap, yielding fringes corresponding to regions of constructive interference. The position of the bright fringes in the horizontal direction is given by
\begin{equation}
X_n^2 = 4 \, \lambda \, R_x \, n - c_x,
\end{equation}

where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
where \(X_n\) is the measured displacement difference for the \(n\)-th fringe, \(\lambda\) is the wavelength of the sodium lamp (\(\lambda \approx 589.3\,\mathrm{nm}\)), \(n\) is an integer representing the fringe order, and \(c_x\) is a constant related to the central air-gap thickness. A similar relation holds for the vertical displacements \(Y_n\) with curvature \(R_y\). Thus, linear regression of plots of \(X_n^2\) and \(Y_n^2\) versus \(n\) allows for the determination of the slopes that are proportional to \(R_x\) and \(R_y\), respectively.\\

The Poisson's ratio is defined as the negative ratio of transverse strain to axial strain under uniaxial stress; for bending, it can be expressed simply as
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{R_x}{R_y},
\end{equation}

where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
since the radii of curvature directly relate to the longitudinal and transverse deformations of the beam. Once \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) are calculated from the fringe data, \(\sigma\) is readily determined.\\

Young's modulus, \(E\), which quantifies the stiffness of the material, is calculated using the bending relation for a beam of rectangular cross-section. The second moment of area for a beam with breadth \(b\) and thickness \(d\) is given by
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{b \, d^3}{12}.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
Under a bending load, the curvature in the horizontal plane is related to the applied moment by
\begin{equation}
\frac{E\,I}{R_x} = m \, g \, a,
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
where \(m\) is the suspended mass, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(a\) is the distance from the support to the point of load application. Rearranging this equation yields
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{12 \, m \, g \, a \, R_x}{b\, d^3}.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula.\\

Thus, by measuring \(R_x\) from the interference fringes and using the beam's physical dimensions along with the applied load, Young's modulus \(E\) can be calculated. In summary, Cornu's method effectively combines optical interferometry with beam theory to provide a non-destructive means of determining the elastic properties of the glass sample through careful analysis of the fringe patterns.

\subsection{Mathematical Derivation \autocite{IITRCornuMethod}}
\noindent

The experimental beam AB is bent under the action of the loads \( W \) hanging at both ends. The bending moment \( G \) at all transverse sections of the central span is related to the longitudinal radius of curvature \( R_1 \) by:
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{YI}{R_1}
\end{equation}
where \( Y \) is the Young's modulus and \( I \) is the moment of inertia of the beam's cross-section:
\begin{equation}
I = \frac{1}{12}bt^3
\end{equation}
with \( b \) as the breadth and \( t \) the thickness of the beam.

If \( d \) is the distance between the knife-edge and the point of load application:
\begin{equation}
G = Wd
\end{equation}

Combining equations (7) and (9):
\begin{equation}
\frac{YI}{R_1} = Wd
\end{equation}

If the beam has an initial curvature \( R_0 \) due to its own weight, the equation becomes:
\begin{equation}
\frac{YI}{R_1} - \frac{YI}{R_0} = Wd
\end{equation}

For another load \( W' \), and radius \( R_1' \), analogously:
\begin{equation}
\frac{YI}{R_1'} - \frac{YI}{R_0} = W'd
\end{equation}

Subtracting these:
\begin{align}
YI &= \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_1'} \right) = (W - W')d \notag \\
\Rightarrow Y &= \frac{(W - W')d}{I\left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_1'} \right)}
\end{align}

Substitute \( I \) from (8):
\begin{equation}
Y = \frac{12(W - W')d}{bt^3 \left( \frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_1'} \right)}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Determining \( R_1 \) from Fringes}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{geometry.png}
    \caption{Fringe Geometry for Determining Radii of Curvature}
\end{figure}

From fringe geometry:
\begin{align}
(2R_1 - O_1P) O_1P &= \left( \frac{X_1}{2} \right)^2 \notag \\
2R_1 \cdot O_1P &= \left( \frac{X_1}{2} \right)^2 \quad \text{(neglecting small } O_1P^2 \text{)}  \\
2R_1 \cdot O_1Q &= \left( \frac{X_n}{2} \right)^2
\end{align}

Subtracting (16) from (15), and using:
\begin{equation}
O_1Q - O_1P = \frac{(n-1)\lambda}{2}
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
yields:
\begin{align}
2R_1 \cdot \frac{(n-1)\lambda}{2} &= \frac{1}{4}(X_n^2 - X_1^2) \notag \\
\Rightarrow R_1 &= \frac{X_n^2 - X_1^2}{4\lambda(n-1)}
\end{align}

For another load \( W' \):
\begin{equation}
R_1' = \frac{X_n'^2 - X_1'^2}{4\lambda(n-1)}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Poisson's Ratio from Transverse Fringes}

Similarly, using vertical fringe data:
\begin{equation}
R_y = \frac{Y_n^2 - Y_1^2}{4\lambda(n-1)}
\end{equation}

Poisson's ratio is:
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{R_x}{R_y} = \frac{X_n^2 - X_1^2}{Y_n^2 - Y_1^2}
\end{equation}

  \label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}

A rectangular glass beam of measured breadth \(b\) and thickness \(d\) was carefully placed on two knife-edge supports such that known masses \(m\) could be suspended at equal distances \(a\) from these supports. The beam's dimensions were determined with vernier calipers and a micrometer screw gauge, ensuring minimal dimensional uncertainty.\\

A flat square glass plate was gently positioned at the beam's center, forming a narrow air gap between the beam's upper surface and the plate. This setup was illuminated by a sodium lamp of wavelength \(\lambda \approx 589.3\,\mathrm{nm}\), and a \(45^\circ\) mirror directed the reflected interference fringes into a stage telescope equipped with \(x\)- and \(y\)-direction micrometers.\\

After focusing the telescope to obtain clear fringes, the fringes were measured first along the horizontal axis and then along the vertical axis by recording pairs of positions \((x',x)\) or \((y',y)\) for each fringe, where each fringe was assigned an integer index \(n\). By subtracting these pairs, the displacements \(\Delta X_n = x - x'\) and \(\Delta Y_n = y - y'\) were found, squared to obtain \(\Delta X_n^2\) and \(\Delta Y_n^2\), and subsequently plotted as functions of \(n\).\\

Linear regressions of these plots determined the slopes corresponding to \(4\,\lambda\,R_x\) and \(4\,\lambda\,R_y\), from which the radii of curvature \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) were calculated. Poisson's ratio was evaluated as \(\sigma = R_x / R_y\), taking each load's horizontal and vertical radii into account.\\

In order to find Young's modulus \(E\), the experiment focused on the primary bending of the beam (horizontal displacement), employing the standard bending formula 
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{12\,m\,g\,a\,R_x}{b\,d^3}.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
The gravitational acceleration \(g\) was taken as \(9.81\,\mathrm{m\,s}^{-2}\), and each measurement's uncertainty, including those in \(b\), \(d\), \(a\), and the slope-derived \(R_x\) and \(R_y\), was used in an error-propagation calculation.\\

From these combined uncertainties, the final values for \(\sigma\) and \(E\) were obtained, providing a reliable characterization of the glass beam's elastic properties.

The following figures display the interference fringe pattern observed on the glass beam when loads is applied to each side.

\subsection{Experimental Measurements and Tabulated Data}
\label{subsec:DATA}
\noindent

The experimental measurements were meticulously recorded and are presented in the following tables. The data comprises fringe measurements for a rectangular glass beam subjected to various loading conditions. Specifically, measurements were obtained for loads of 1\,kg, 3\,kg, 4\,kg, 5\,kg, and 6\,kg, with each load yielding data in two distinct orientations: horizontal and vertical.\\

For each mass and orientation, the tables list the fringe index \(n\), the micrometer readings from both sides of the central fringe (denoted \(x'\) and \(x\) in the horizontal orientation, or \(y'\) and \(y\) in the vertical orientation), the computed difference (\(X = x - x'\) or \(Y = y - y'\)), the squared difference (\(X^2\) or \(Y^2\)), and the associated uncertainty (\(\delta X^2\) or \(\delta Y^2\)). These computed quantities are critical for determining the radii of curvature of the beam under each load, which are subsequently used to extract the elastic properties of the glass.\\

In total, there are five tables: five for the horizontal data and vertical data. Each pair of horizontal and vertical tables for a given load enables a comprehensive analysis of the interference fringe pattern, thereby providing a robust basis for calculating both Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus.\\

The data presented in the tables clearly illustrates the expected trend between the fringe order \(n\) and the computed squared differences (\(X^2\) or \(Y^2\)). As the fringe index increases, both the absolute difference in the micrometer readings and hence their squares also increase, in accordance with the theoretical prediction that
\begin{equation}
X_n^2 = 4\,\lambda\,R_x\,n - c_x.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
This linear relationship implies that higher fringe numbers correspond to larger path differences in the interference pattern, which is directly related to the bending curvature of the beam.\\

Based on the data in ~\autoref{tab:1kg-hv}--\autoref{tab:6kg-hv}, the squared deflections \(X^2\) and \(Y^2\) scale monotonically with the index \(n\) for each applied load. For instance, in the 1 kg horizontal measurements, \(X^2\) increases from 63.20\,mm\(^2\) at \(n=1\) to 1399.51\,mm\(^2\) at \(n=4\), while the corresponding vertical values grow from 331.60\,mm\(^2\) to 982.20\,mm\(^2\). The 3 kg dataset shows a rise in \(X^2\) from 19.18\,mm\(^2\) to 642.12\,mm\(^2\) and in \(Y^2\) from 380.25\,mm\(^2\) to 1288.81\,mm\(^2\); similar linear trends are evident for 4 kg, 5 kg, and 6 kg. These consistent linear relationships confirm our beam model, in which the applied load alters the slope of the \(X^2\)–\(n\) (or \(Y^2\)–\(n\)) line and thus the inferred radius of curvature.\\


Minor deviations from perfect linearity, seen as slight fluctuations in the squared fringe differences and their uncertainties (\(\delta X^2\) and \(\delta Y^2\)), suggest the influence of practical experimental factors. These include imperfections in the flatness of the glass surfaces, misalignments in the optical setup, and ambient vibrations during measurements. As \(n\) increases, any small inconsistencies in measurement may become amplified due to the larger fringe separations, which in turn affect the overall slope determination.\\

Ultimately, the observed changes in \(X^2\) and \(Y^2\) with respect to \(n\) not only confirm the linear dependency predicted by the theoretical model but also provide a reliable basis for calculating the radii of curvature. This is essential for further determining the elastic properties, such as Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus, of the glass beam. The robust and systematic behavior of the data with respect to the fringe order underscores the validity of using interference fringe analysis in material characterization.\\

\subsection{Linear Regression of Squared Displacements}
\label{subsec:LINEAR REGRESSION}
\indent 

The following figures display the linear regression plots of the squared fringe separations versus the fringe order for both horizontal and vertical orientations across different loads. These graphs provide a visual confirmation of the expected linear relationships derived from Cornu's method, where the slope of each line is directly proportional to the corresponding radius of curvature. By examining these plots, one can clearly observe how increasing the fringe order leads to larger squared displacements, thereby validating the theoretical model and facilitating the extraction of elastic properties.\\

The analysis began by recording the interference fringe positions in both the horizontal and vertical orientations for each applied load. For each set of measurements, the fringe displacements were used to compute the squared fringe separations, \(X_n^2\) (horizontal) and \(Y_n^2\) (vertical), which were then plotted against the fringe order \(n\). Linear regression of these plots produced slopes that, according to the theoretical relationship 
\begin{equation}
X_n^2 = 4\,\lambda\,R_x\,n - c_x \quad \text{and} \quad Y_n^2 = 4\,\lambda\,R_y\,n - c_y,
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
are proportional to the radii of curvature \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) in each direction. The slopes, originally measured in \(\mathrm{mm}^2\), were converted to \(\mathrm{m}^2\) by dividing by \(10^6\), ensuring consistency with the wavelength \(\lambda \approx 589.3 \, \mathrm{nm}\) expressed in meters. From these conversions, the radii of curvature were determined using
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\text{slope}}{4\,\lambda}.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula.

\noindent

Subsequently, Poisson's ratio was calculated as the ratio of the horizontal to vertical radii of curvature, i.e.,
\begin{equation}
\sigma = \frac{R_x}{R_y}.
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
Individual measurements for each load resulted in values that, when averaged, yielded a final Poisson's ratio of \(\sigma = 0.40 \pm 0.02\).\\

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent

For Young's modulus, the analysis focused on the horizontal data only, as the primary bending occurs in this plane. The radius \(R_x\) obtained from the horizontal fringe measurements was combined with the beam's geometrical parameters and loading conditions through the standard bending equation
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{12\,m\,g\,a\,R_x}{b\,d^3},
\end{equation}
where \(R_x\) is the horizontal curvature and \(R_y\) is the vertical curvature. The bending moment induced by the applied loads is also related to the beam's geometry and material properties. By applying beam-bending theory, the second moment of area is calculated, and the relationship between the applied load, the beam's dimensions, and the curvature is established. This relationship allows for the calculation of Young's modulus \(E\) using the formula
where \(m\) is the suspended mass, \(g\) is gravitational acceleration, \(a\) is the distance from the support to the load application point, \(b\) is the breadth, and \(d\) is the thickness of the beam. Uncertainties in the measured slopes (and hence in \(R_x\)) as well as those in the beam dimensions were propagated using standard error analysis, resulting in an average Young's modulus of \(E = 73.81 \pm 1.86\,\mathrm{GPa}\).\\

\subsection{Comparison with Reference Values}
\noindent

To assess the accuracy of the experimental results, the obtained values for Poisson's ratio and Young's modulus were compared with established reference values for soda-lime glass. The standard literature value for Poisson's ratio is approximately \(\sigma_{\text{ref}} = 0.30\) \autocite{Li2025NegativePoisson}, while the accepted range for Young's modulus is typically between \(65\) and \(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\) \autocite{ElMoneim1998Elastic} \autocite{Sharpe2007Strain}.\\

The experimentally determined average Poisson's ratio was \(\sigma = 0.40 \pm 0.02\), representing a noticeable overestimation when compared to the reference. The calculated percentage discrepancy is approximately \(33.33\%\), which suggests potential sources of systematic error—such as alignment inaccuracies, resolution limitations in vertical fringe measurements, or cumulative optical distortions.\\

In contrast, the experimental average Young's modulus was found to be \(E = 73.81 \pm 1.86\,\mathrm{GPa}\), falling well within the accepted literature range. The percentage discrepancy relative to the lower bound (\(65\,\mathrm{GPa}\)) is \(10.48\%\), while the deviation from the upper bound (\(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\)) is just \(4.25\%\). These small deviations demonstrate the robustness of the experimental procedure and suggest that the bending-based optical fringe method is highly effective for determining Young's modulus.\\

\subsection{Summary of Findings}
\noindent 

In summary, although the Poisson's ratio result shows a larger deviation from the expected value, the Young's modulus measurement exhibits strong agreement with standard references. These outcomes validate the experimental design, the precision of fringe displacement measurements, and the reliability of the data analysis approach. Ultimately, the combination of interference fringe tracking and beam-bending theory has proven to be a suitable and accurate technique for extracting elastic properties of glass.\\

\section{\centering DISCUSSION}
\label{sec:DISCUSSION}
% Content for the DISCUSSION section goes here.
\indent 

As the applied load on the glass beam increased from 1 kg to 6 kg, a distinct compression of the interference fringe patterns was observed in both horizontal and vertical orientations. This trend, evident in \autoref{subsec:FRINGE PATTERN}, corresponds to an increase in the beam’s curvature, leading to a denser fringe distribution. The physical basis for this lies in beam-bending theory: as load increases, the bending moment \( M = mga \) also increases, resulting in greater deformation of the beam and a smaller radius of curvature \( R \). Consequently, the optical path difference per fringe increases, compressing the fringes spatially and making them appear closer together.\\

From the data in \autoref{subsec:DATA}, it is clear that the fringe displacement differences \( X \) and \( Y \), and more importantly their squared values \( X_n^2 \) and \( Y_n^2 \), increase consistently with increasing of fringe index \( n \) and decrease consistently with increasing of load. This trend aligns with the theoretical model described in \autoref{sec:THEORY}, where the squared fringe separations follow the relationships
\[
X_n^2 = 4\lambda R_x n - c_x \quad \text{and} \quad Y_n^2 = 4\lambda R_y n - c_y,
\]
with \(R_x\) and \(R_y\) being the horizontal and vertical curvatures of the beam, respectively.\\

As the applied load increases, the beam experiences greater bending, which leads to a smaller radius of curvature. Consequently, the slopes of the \( X_n^2 \) vs. \( n \) and \( Y_n^2 \) vs. \( n \) plots become gentler. This compressive trend in fringe spacing confirms the validity of the optical method and the predictable elastic response of the glass beam.\\

The experimental data demonstrate a clear, nearly linear relationship between the squared fringe separations and the fringe order, thereby validating the theoretical predictions of Cornu's method. The slopes obtained from linear regressions in \autoref{subsec:LINEAR REGRESSION} yield the radii of curvature \(R_x\) and \(R_y\), which are then used to compute Poisson's ratio via \(\sigma = R_x / R_y\), and—together with the beam's geometric parameters and applied load—Young's modulus \(E\).\\

Minor deviations from perfect linearity were observed and can be attributed to practical factors inherent in the experiment. Imperfections in the flatness of the glass surfaces for both the beam and the reference plate may lead to variations in the local air-gap thickness, thereby affecting the fringe pattern. Additionally, slight misalignments in the optical setup, particularly in the orientation of the stage telescope and the 45° mirror, can induce systematic errors in fringe position measurements. Ambient vibrations, whether originating from building activity or other laboratory disturbances, further contribute to fluctuations, especially at higher fringe orders where small errors are amplified.\\

These measurement uncertainties propagate through the analysis, affecting the determination of the slopes and, subsequently, the calculated radii of curvature, Poisson's ratio, and Young's modulus. Despite these challenges, careful error propagation in the linear regression analysis produced final values of \(\sigma = 0.40 \pm 0.02\) and \(E = 73.81 \pm 1.86\,\mathrm{GPa}\), which are broadly consistent with typical literature values for soda-lime glass.\\

To further evaluate the accuracy of these results, a comparison was made against standard reference values: the literature value for Poisson's ratio is approximately \(\sigma_{\text{ref}} = 0.30\), while the accepted range for Young's modulus lies between \(65\) and \(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\). The discrepancy in Poisson's ratio was calculated to be approximately \(33.33\%\), indicating a systematic overestimation. This deviation may stem from experimental asymmetries, such as slight misalignments in vertical fringe tracking or optical distortion affecting the fringe radius estimation in the vertical plane.\\

On the other hand, the experimentally determined Young's modulus shows significantly better agreement with accepted values. The percentage discrepancy from the lower bound of the expected range (\(65\,\mathrm{GPa}\)) is \(10.48\%\), and from the upper bound (\(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\)) is only \(4.25\%\). These small deviations affirm that the experimental setup and computational procedures used to determine Young's modulus are both precise and reliable. They also highlight that while the experimental estimation of Poisson's ratio is more sensitive to vertical fringe measurements, the determination of \(E\) from horizontal curvature is considerably more robust and less prone to systematic error.\\

To further improve the experiment, enhanced surface preparation and the use of higher-quality optical flats could reduce errors caused by surface irregularities. Moreover, employing rigid, vibration-isolated mounts for the optical components and incorporating automated fringe detection with digital image processing would likely minimize misalignments and human errors. Future investigations might explore varying load conditions or examine alternative materials with different elastic properties. Additionally, extending the method to include temperature-dependent studies could provide deeper insights into material behavior under varying environmental conditions. Another promising improvement would be the use of polarized light or wavelength-tunable laser sources, which can enhance fringe contrast and resolution, thereby improving the precision of fringe measurement. These improvements would not only refine the accuracy of the current method but also broaden its applicability in material characterization studies.To further improve the experiment, enhanced surface preparation and the use of higher-quality optical flats could reduce errors caused by surface irregularities.

Another promising improvement would be the use of polarized or wavelength-tunable laser sources, which can enhance fringe contrast and resolution, thereby improving the precision of fringe measurement.\\

Building on recent literature, such as the comprehensive study of Poisson’s ratios across a variety of glasses, ceramics, and crystals by Kojima \textit{et al.}~\autocite{Kojima2024Poisson}, future work could explore the applicability of Cornu’s method to more complex or anisotropic materials. The cited work highlights material-specific Poisson’s ratios and the sensitivity of measurement techniques to underlying structure and bonding characteristics. Investigating whether optical interferometry methods such as Cornu’s remain accurate across different crystalline symmetries or amorphous structures would be valuable for broadening the method’s utility in material characterization.\\

These improvements would not only refine the accuracy of the current method but also expand its applicability to a wider range of engineering and materials science contexts.

\indent 

The experiment successfully determined the elastic properties of a glass beam using Cornu's method based on optical interferometry. The average Poisson's ratio was found to be \(\sigma = 0.40 \pm 0.02\), while the average Young's modulus was calculated as \(E = 73.81 \pm 1.86\,\mathrm{GPa}\). Although the Poisson's ratio exhibits a notable discrepancy of approximately \(33.33\%\) from the typical literature value of \(0.30\), the measured Young's modulus falls well within the accepted range of \(65\)–\(75\,\mathrm{GPa}\), with a discrepancy of only \(10.48\%\) from the lower bound and \(4.25\%\) from the upper bound.\\
