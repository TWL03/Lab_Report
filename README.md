# 🔬 Physics Laboratory Reports – Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)

This repository presents a comprehensive collection of laboratory reports authored by **TAN WEI LIANG**, a Physics undergraduate at **Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM)**.

All experiments were conducted as part of USM’s core physics laboratory modules. Each report includes detailed procedures, data analysis, theoretical discussion, and LaTeX-formatted documentation.  
**Please note:** The official lab manuals used in these experiments are authored by the School of Physics, USM.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder contains:

- `lab_report.pdf` — Final submitted report  
- `report.tex` — LaTeX source code  
- `data/` — Raw or processed data (CSV, XLSX, etc.)  
- `figures/` — Graphs and diagrams included in the report

## 🔧 Compiling LaTeX Reports

All reports are written using LaTeX (some are Docs). You may compile them locally or online.

### Local Compilation

```bash
cd reports/<experiment-folder>
pdflatex report.tex
bibtex report
pdflatex report.tex
pdflatex report.tex
```
### Online Compilation

You can also upload report.tex to Overleaf for browser-based editing.

Common packages used:
	•	amsmath, graphicx, siunitx, caption, float, tikz, hyperref, biblatex


## 📊 Tools Used for Analysis
	•	🐍 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for numerical analysis and plotting
	•	📊 Excel / Google Sheets for raw data tabulation
