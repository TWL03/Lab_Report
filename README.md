## 🔧 Compiling LaTeX Reports

All reports are written using LaTeX (some are Docs). You may compile them locally or online.

### Local Compilation

You can Run the LaTeX in Visual Studio Code or LaTeX Works:

Download LaTeX: https://www.latex-project.org/get/

### Online Compilation

You can also upload report.tex to Overleaf for browser-based editing.

Common packages used:
-	amsmath, graphicx, siunitx, caption, float, tikz, hyperref, biblatex


## 📊 Tools Used for Analysis
-	🐍 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) for numerical analysis and plotting
-	📊 Excel / Google Sheets for raw data tabulation
-	📄 LaTeX for scientific writing
-	📓 Jupyter Notebooks (occasionally) for simulation and plotting


## 📚 References

Each experiment report includes a bibliography citing:
-	Fundamentals of Physics, Halliday, Resnick & Walker
-	University Physics, Young & Freedman
-	PHYWE and UCSD lab notes
-	Official lab manuals from the School of Physics, USM
-	Additional scientific articles where relevant
-	...
